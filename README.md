## About The Project

There are many great Discord bots out there, but I wanted to develop my own. I wanted the freedom of being able to easily add my own commands and tailor it to my own needs. After thinking a bit about which language to use, I decided on developing it in Go. I decided on Go after my newfound love for the programming language after the cloud technologies course I had during my bachelor in programming. Of course this Discord bot may not cover all of your own needs, but you're more than welcome to fork this repo and change it how you like.
